# Hobbyfy-UI-UX-Case-Study
Hobbyfy is a UI/UX design project that creates a platform where users can explore, buy, and sell hobby-related products. The design is developed using Jesse James Garrett’s 5 Planes of User Experience, ensuring clarity, smooth navigation, and a visually appealing interface that supports both user and business needs.
